Tuples are very similar to a list, except they have immutability!
This means that any values associated to them can not be changed once assigned!

Tuples also use parenthesis: (1,2,3)
Lists use square brackets: [1,2,3]


Tuple Examples: 
t = ('one', 2)
#you can use indexing & splicing just like lists
t[0] ===> 'one'

IMMUTABILITY 

List Example: 
    mylist = [0, 2, 4]

    mylist[2] = 'NEW'

    mylist => [0,2, 'NEW']


Tuples Example: 
    mytups = (1, 3, 5)

    mytups[0] = 'NEW'

    ====>>>> ERROR



Tuples provide a data integrety. The fact you can't reassign by accident because you will get an error code....lets your data be certain.



the only 2 types of methods that can be used with Tuples are 
        .count()
        .index()




        *Important! 
                    ~ because List have a multitude of methods associated with them!
