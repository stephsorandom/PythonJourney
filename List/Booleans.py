Booleans are statement that show if that condition is met, will it either be True or False

    ** Sure you capitalize the first letter: 
                    True        or       False


    Ex: 
        1 > 2 
        = True


~ You can set a variable to be none..incase you need to use it for later on but want to declare it now. 
            b = None 
                    ==> Will not give kyou an error when declared until you are ready to assign it a value
