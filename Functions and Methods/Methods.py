Methods are basically built in objects into Functions

mylist = [1,2,3]

mylist.append(4) ##adds 4 into list
    ==> [1,2,3,4]
    

mylist.pop() ##removes last item on list
    ==> [1,2,3]

help(mylist.insert)  ##built into python it will return the documentation of what you are looking for
    ==> Help on built-in function.insert:
            insert(..) method of builtins.list instance
                L.insert(index, object) -- insert object before index
