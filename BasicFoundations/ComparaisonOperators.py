Comparision Operators can be : 
                    and or not 
    
    AND EX:
    1 < 2 < 3 ===>>>> True. Because 1 is less than 2 and 2 is less than 3
    1 < 2 and 2 < 3 ===>> True. Because compares both sides to see if true or false. 

    'h' == 'h' and 2 == 2 ====>>> True! 


    OR EX: 
    1 == 1 OR 2 == 3 ===>>> TRUE! With 'or' just needs 1 arguement to be true. 


    NOT EX:
    You return the opposite boolean of what is being asked. 

        not 1 == 1  =>>> False
        400 > 5000  =>>> False, because 400 is less
        not 400 > 5000 ===> True. Because 400 is less than 5000, so it is NOT true
